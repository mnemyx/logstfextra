## SupStats2 - Extra Details Parser
> A python + php script that parses out TF2 logs generated by F2's SupStats2 (this will not work with SupStats! It needs the detailed damage logs in order to work)


## How it works
> Python Part:
>
> 1.) Requires the log file's location as a command line argument
>
> 2.) Parses through the log, saves each line as an element of an array/list, & closes the log file
>
> 3.) Then parses through the array of lines
>
>	* Will only account for damage dealt bewtween "Round_Start" and "Round_Win" conditions
>
> 4.) Serializes the python dictionaries for damaged received and damage given via json.dumps()
>
>
> PHP Part:
>
> 1.) Uses a $_GET variable to get the log file's name
>
> 2.) Invokes python script via shell_exec()
>
> 3.) Uses json_decode() to parse the json string to associative arrays
>
> 4.) Displays the data


## JSON Structure
###### There are 2 versions of extrastats.py: *noclasses/extrastats.py* and *extrastats.py*. Their structure differs a bit as *noclasses/extrastats.py* does not require as much detailed data as *extrastats.py*:

> ###### *noclasses/extrastats.py* structure:
	[ 
		[ damage_given : 
			{ 
				*player_name* : 
					{
						pdata : 
							{
								team : *Red|Blue*,
								steamid : *STEAM_0:#:########*,
								playernum : *#*
							}
						players : {
							*player_name* : {
								da : *damage amount*,
								pdata : 
									{
										team : *Red|Blue*,
										steamid : *STEAM_0:#:########*,
										playernum : *#*
									}
							}
						}
					}
			}
		],
		[ damage_received : 
			{ 
				*player_name* : 
					{
